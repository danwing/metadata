         Flow Metadata for Collaborative Host/Network Signaling
                draft-rwbr-sconepro-flow-metadata-latest

Abstract

   This document defines per-flow and per-packet metadata for both
   network-to-host and host-to-network signaling in Concise Data
   Definition Language (CDDL) which expresses both CBOR and JSON.  The
   common metadata definition allows interworking between signaling
   protocols with high fidelity.  The metadata is also self- describing
   to improve interpretation by network elements and endpoints while
   reducing the need for version negotiation.

1.  Introduction

   Historically, metadata is defined within each protocol.  While this
   can be very efficient on the wire (e.g., DSCP consumes only 6 bits)
   it suffers from inability to authorize or authenticate the metadata
   signaling.  But the more signifcant problem is inability to interwork
   between signaling protocols because each have different definitions.
   Such interworking is often needed when the metadata signaling
   protocol for packets leaving a network differs from the metadata
   signaling protocol entering a different network.  For example,
   important packets leaving a server and its network might be marked
   with DSCP (as the sending host is known and trusted) but the
   receiving network doesn't trust the DSCP bits in received packets
   because there is no authorization or authentication for differented
   treatment.

   By using the same metadata, both networks can communicate how packets
   should be treated and use their own signaling mechanism with their
   network elements (e.g., routers, [MASQUE] proxies).

   Both the above use cases are improved by metadata described in this
   document.  This document is a companion to host-to-network signaling
   the metadata itself, such as:

   *  UDP Options (e.g., [I-D.kaippallimalil-tsvwg-media-hdr-wireless],
      [I-D.reddy-tsvwg-explcit-signal]),

   *  IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options (Section 4.3 of [RFC8200]),

   *  SCONE Protocol ([SCONEPRO]), or

   *  QUIC CID mapping ([I-D.wing-cidfi]).

   [I-D.herbert-host2netsig] provides an analysis of most of those
   metadata signaling mechanisms.

   This document does not assume nor preclude any companion signaling
   protocol.  Also, the document does not preclude API-based approaches
   to control flows, packets, applications, etc. that are bound to a
   given metadata and which will benefit from the differentiated
   behavior.  As such, *the metadata in this document is defined to be
   independent of the signaling protocol* (Section 3).  In doing so, we
   ensure that consistent metadata definitions are used by the various
   signaling protocols.  Also, this approach allows to factorize key
   considerations such as security and operational considerations.  This
   approach also ease passing policies between controllers of domains
   involved in packet delivery (e.g., RAN, Core, and Transport domains).

   The metadata is described using Concise Data Definition Language
   (CDDL) [CDDL] which can be expressed in both [JSON] and binary using
   [CBOR].  Both the JSON and CBOR encodings are self-describing.  It is
   out of scope of this document to define how the proposed encoding
   will be mapped to a specific signaling protocol.

   If the companion signaling protocol supports host-to-network
   metadata, individual packets within a flow can contain metadata
   describing their drop preference or their reliability.  The network
   elements aware of this metadata can apply preferential or deferential
   treatment to those packets during a 'reactive traffic policy' event.
   It is also assumed that such network elements are provisioned with
   local policy that guides their behavior jointly with a signaled
   metadata.  Examples of metadata signaling for video streaming and for
   remote desktop are provided in Appendix A.

   For network-to-host metadata, a host can be informed of network
   policy for nominal downlink bandwidth.  Certain applications, such as
   most especially video streaming applications, can use that
   information to optimize their video streaming bandwidth to fit within
   that policy.

   To track metadata that are defined for host/network signalling, a new
   IANA registry is defined: "Flow Metadata Registry" Section 10.2.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the following terms:

   Reactive policy:  Treatment given to a flow when an exceptional event
      occurs, such as diminished throughput to the host caused by radio
      interference or weak radio signal, congestion on the network
      caused by other users or other applications on the same host.

   Intentional policy:  Configured bandwidth, pps, or similar throughput
      constraints applied to a flow, application, host, or subscriber.

3.  Metadata Structure

   The metadata is described in CDDL [RFC8610] format shown in Figure 1.

   ; one or more metadata can be signaled.
   metadata = {
     metadata-type: (0..1), ; 0 is Network Metadata
                            ; 1 is Application Metadata
     * $$metadata-extensions
   }

   ; Application Metadata

   $$metadata-extensions //= (
   ; true indicates packet of high importance
   ; false indicates packet of low importance
     importance: bool,
   ; Packets can be tagged as reliable (true) or unreliable (false)
     reliable: bool,
   ; Packets can be tagged as preference to keep (true) or discard (false)
     prefer-keep: bool
   ; Has a meaning only for packets marked as reliable
   ; True indicates realtime
   ; False indicates bulk (non-realtime)
     realtime: bool
   )

   ; Network Metadata

   ; Provides information about the nominal downlink bitrate
   ; Returning a value set to 0 (or a very low value) should trigger
   ; the host to seek for better paths.

   Bitrate =  {
     scope: uint     ; indicates the scope the bitrate
     nominal: uint,  ; Mbps
     ? burst-d => burst-info
   }

   burst-info = {
     burst: uint,          ; Mbps
     burstDuration: uint   ; milliseconds
   }

   $$metadata-extensions //= (
      ? downlinkBitrate => Bitrate,
   ; Indicates whether a flow is to be offloaded to alternate
   ; available paths.
      pref-alt-path: bool
   )

   downlinkBitrate = "downlinkBitrate"
   burst-d = "burst-info"

                  Figure 1: CDDL Structure of the Metadata

   The structure shown in Figure 1 does not assume that the metadata
   will be encoded as a single blob when mapped to a signaling protocol
   or that all the metadata components will be mapped.  Such matters are
   specific to the individual signaling protocols and deployment
   contexts.

   New metadata for collaborative host/network signaling MUST be
   registered in the IANA registry, "Flow Metadata Registry"
   Section 10.2.

   More details about each of these metadata are provided in Section 4
   and Section 5.  Both client and network intended behaviors are
   specified for each metadata.

4.  Host-to-Network Metadata

   Metadata is characterized into two different nature:

   Network Metadata:  This consists of metadata that specifies how a
      network element should treat that packet.  The network metadata
      comprises of the importance metadata.  This field indicates
      whether a packet is more important or less important.

   Application Metadata:  This consists of metadata that specifies how
      the application treats that packet.  The appplication metadata
      comprises of two components: Keep/Discard and Reliable/Unreliable.

4.1.  Packet Importance ('Importance')

   The "Importance" metadata signifies if the packet is of more
   important (true) or less important (false) by the host, relative to
   other packets in the same flow.  Importance belongs to Network
   Metadata.

   An application would mark a packet as important when it needs the
   network to treat the packet with greater preference compared to the
   unmarked packets or to packets marked important=false (of the same
   flow).  This tagging does not provide more privileges to an
   application with regards to resources usage compared to the absence
   of signal.  An example of this interpretation is specified in
   Appendix A.

4.1.1.  Network Treatment

   During a reactive policy event, a network element is encouraged to
   discard packets marked importance=false in favor of packets marked
   importance=true, for the same flow.

4.2.  Packet Type - Reliable/Unreliable ('PacketType')

   The "Reliable" metadata indicates if a packet is reliably transmitted
   by the host.

   *  Reliable packets are re-transmitted by the underlying transport
      (e.g., TCP [RFC9293] or [QUIC]) or re-transmitted by the
      appplication (e.g., [RELIABLE-RTP], NTP).

   *  Unreliable packets are not re-transmitted by the transport (e.g.,
      UDP, [RTP], [LOSSY-QUIC]) and also not re-transmitted by the
      application (e.g., [RTP]).

   Packets marked reliable, if delayed excessively or dropped outright,
   will be re-transmitted (up to a maximum retries) by the sender
   application, appearing on the network again.  Thus, delaying or
   discarding such packets does not reduce the amount of transmitted
   data in a network; it only defers when it appears on the network.

   Reliable/Unreliable belongs to Application Metadata.

4.2.1.  Network Treatment

   During a reactive policy event, dropping unreliable traffic is
   preferred over dropping reliable traffic.  The reliable traffic will
   be re-transmitted by the sender so dropping such traffic only defers
   it until later, but this deferral can be useful.

4.3.  Packet Nature ('PacketNature')

   This metadata indicates discard preference for unreliable traffic and
   reliable traffic, as detailed below.

4.3.1.  Unreliable Traffic

   Packets are marked with 'prefer-keep' set to either true or false.
   When set to true, it indicates a preference to keep the packet.
   Conversely, when set to false, it signals that the packet may be
   subject to discard based on a reactive policy.

   Many flows contain a mix of important packets and less-important
   packets, but applications seldom signal that difference themselves
   let alone signal the difference to the network.  Rather, applications
   send everything over a reliable transport (TCP or QUIC) and leave it
   at that, as evidenced by video streaming using TCP.

   With the advent of [LOSSY-QUIC], applications can send both [QUIC]
   reliable traffic and [LOSSY-QUIC] unreliable traffic [LOSSY-QUIC] on
   the same 5-tuple.  With host-to-network metadata signaling, the
   network can become an active assistant in such flows during a
   reactive policy event by endeavouring to send the more-important
   'prefer-keep' traffic at the expense of the less-important 'may-
   discard' traffic.

   The reason why an application transmits a packet marked as 'prefer-
   keep' set to false, when the application has the capability to avoid
   sending that packet, is application-specific.

4.3.1.1.  Network Treatment

   During a reactive policy event, dropping packets with 'prefer-keep'
   set to false is preferred over dropping 'prefer-keep' set to true
   packets.  Absent such discard preference indication, the network
   element will blindly drop packets during a reactive policy event.

4.3.2.  Reliable Traffic

   For reliable traffic, "realtime" metadata indicates whether the
   packet belongs to bulk or real-time traffic.

   An application such as a web browser might mark certain flows as
   realtime (e.g., the flow is related to dynamically updating a search
   box and quick responses help the user experience) and other flows as
   bulk (e.g., file download, file upload).

4.3.2.1.  Network Treatment

   Realtime traffic prefers lower latency network paths and bulk traffic
   prefers high throughoupt paths.

5.  Network to Host Metadata

5.1.  Downlink Bitrate ('DownlinkBitrate')

   Monthly data quotas on cellular networks can be easily exceeded by
   video streaming, in particular, if the client chooses excessively
   high quality or routinely abandons watching videos that were
   downloaded.  The network can assist the client by informing the
   client of the network's bandwidth policy.

   If the video is encoded with variable bitrate, the bitrate cannot
   exceed the indicated bitrate.

   The scope indicates whether the bitrate applies to all flows bound to
   a host (0), a specific application (1), a traffic category (2), etc.
   "0" is default value.  The absence of scope is similar to returning a
   scope set to "0".

   The nominal bitrate is calculated over each second, whereas the burst
   bitrate is calculated over the signaled interval (burst-duration).
   For either measurement, packets can arrive at the start of a second,
   as near as possible behind each other, and the remaining portion of
   that second could have no packets transmitted.

5.1.1.  Units

   Bitrate is expressed in Mbps and duration is in milliseconds.

5.1.2.  Host Treatment

   The host chooses a video streaming bitrate at or below the signaled
   rate.

   The host may also choose to signal the received bitrate to the remote
   peer.  The remote peer will adapt its transmission behavior to comply
   with the received bitrate.

   An example of the encoding is provided in Appendix B.

5.2.  Prefer Alternate Path ('pref-alt-path')

   There are also crisis cases where nominal network resources cannot be
   used at maximum to handle packets.  A network would thus seek to
   offload some of the traffic during these events.  Under such
   exceptional events, a network element may signal to a host that it is
   preferrable to use alternate paths, if available.  An alternate path
   is typically an alternate network attachment.  After the crisis has
   subsided, the network should signal with pref-alt-path=false.

   The 'pref-alt-path' metadata may be sent together with the bitrate
   metadata (Section 5.1) set to a very low value.

5.2.1.  Host Treatment

   The host offloads its connections to alternate available paths.

6.  Guidance For Mapping Metadata to Specific Signaling Protocols

   TBC.

7.  Implementation Impact of Metadata

7.1.  Reliable/Unreliable set by the respective transport level protocol

   TCP [RFC9293] is a reliable transport protocol, while UDP [RFC0768]
   provides a minimal, unreliable, best-effort, message-passing
   transport to applications and other protocols (such as tunnels) that
   wish to operate over IP [RFC8085].  Protocols built over UDP may
   implement reliability features at the "application" layer if such a
   transport feature is needed [RFC8304].  For example, streams of
   reliable application data are sent using STREAM QUIC frames
   (Section 19.8 of [RFC9000]), while application data that do not
   require retransmission can be carried in DATAGRAM QUIC frames
   [RFC9221].  Applications that are utilizing such a protocol, will
   have to choose the delivery service (reliable or loss-tolerant) based
   upon the nature of the packet being sent -- loss-tolerant packet
   cannot be carried in a reliable frame and vice-versa.  Hence, based
   on the transport service being invoked, setting of the reliable/
   unreliable metadata entry can be offloaded to the underlying
   transport protocol, unless specifically overridden by the
   application.

7.2.  Offloading Loss-Avoidance to the network

   Network nodes, upon learning of the nature of a packet (reliable/
   prefer-keep) can choose to implement loss avoidance algorithms
   between hops where there is packet loss detected (e.g., using out-of-
   band or in-band QoS measurement, which is out of the scope of this
   document).  By doing so, end-to-end retransmissions can be reduced/
   avoided thereby minimizing the need for handling loss at the
   application layer using protocols such as [RFC7198], [RFC7197], or
   [RFC7104].

8.  Manageability Considerations

8.1.  Impact on Network Operation

   TBC.

9.  Security Considerations

   Metadata increases the information available to attackers to
   distinguish important packets from less-important packets, which the
   attacker might use to attack such packets (e.g., prevent their
   delivery) or attempt to decrypt those packets.  It is RECOMMENDED to
   encrypt or obfuscate the metadata information so it is only available
   to hosts and to authorized network elements.  The method of
   encryption or obfuscation is not described in this document but
   rather in other documents describing how this metadata is encoded and
   exchanged amongst hosts and network elements.

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  Metadata for Collaborative Host/Network Signaling Registry Group

   This document requests IANA to create a new registry group, entitled
   "Metadata for Collaborative Host/Network Signaling".

10.2.  Flow Metadata Registry

   IANA is requested to create a new registry, entitled "Flow Metadata
   Registry", under the "Metadata for Collaborative Host/Network
   Signaling" registry group.  This registry is inspired by the
   "Performance Metrics Registry" created by [RFC8911].  The structure
   of the registry is as follows:

   Identifier:  A numeric identifier for the registered metadata.

      The Identifier 0 is Reserved.

      The Identifier values from 250 to 255 are reserved for private or
      experimental use.

   Name:  Name of the registered metadata.

   Description:  Provides a description of the intended use of the
      registered metadata.

   Reference:  Lists the authoritative reference that specifies the
      registered metadata.

   Version:  Tracks the current version of the metadata.

      The initial version of a new registered metadata MUST be 1.0.

      IANA will bump the version when a new RFC that changes the format/
      semantic of a registered entry.

   The initial values of the registry are listed in Table 1.

                          Table 1: Initial Values

   New values in the 6-99 range can be assigned using "Standards Action"
   policy (Section 4.9 of [RFC8126]).

   Values in the 100-149 range can be assigned using "Expert Review"
   policy (Section 4.5 of [RFC8126]).

   Values in the 150-249 range can be assigned using "First Come First
   Served" (Section 4.4 of [RFC8126]).  This range can be, e.g., used by
   other SDOs to register metadata that are specific to their domain and
   which is not used outside that scope.

Appendix B.  Example of Network-to-Host Metadata for Video Streaming

   A network element can signal the maximum bandwidth allowed for video
   streaming.  Typically, this policy limit exists in cellular networks.

   The example shown in Figure 2 indicates the burst bandwidth (2 Mbps),
   burst duration (3 seconds), and nominal (non-burst) bandwidth (1
   Mbps) for the requesting user.  The scope "1" indicates the bitrate
   is per-host.

   {
     "downlinkBitrate": {
       "scope": 0,
       "nominal": 1024,
       "burst": 2048,
       "burstDuration": 3000
     }
